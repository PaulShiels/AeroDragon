        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.ContentData">
            <summary>

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.Content">
            <summary>
            Allows to load type derived from ContentData (images, sounds, xml files, levels, etc.) and
            returns a cached useable instance of the given type. Most importantly provides an easy and
            quick access to all cached resources, but also provides advanced content service downloading.

            <summary>
            Provides ticks for the Time class via the System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch class. This class is

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.ElapsedTime">
            <summary>
            Provides Ticks for the Time class to measure time differences between frames. Can easily be
            mocked for tests and replaced with platforms framework classes for better accuracy and speed.

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.StackTraceExtensions">
            <summary>
            Provides additional check methods on stack traces to find out where we are (e.g. in tests)

        </member>
        <member name="M:DeltaEngine.Core.StackTraceExtensions.GetEntryName">
            <summary>
            Get entry name from stack frame, which is either the namespace name where the main method
            is located or if we are started from a test, the name of the test method.

        <member name="P:DeltaEngine.Core.StackTraceExtensions.IsVisualTestCase">
            <summary>

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.ExceptionExtensions">
            <summary>
            Categorizes exceptions into fatal and weak ones. Fatal exceptions are always rethrown and weak
            ones (most likely simple programming mistakes) can be logged and ignored if no debugger is
            attached. See http://vasters.com/clemensv/2012/09/06/Are+You+Catching+Falling+Knives.aspx

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.Presenter">
            <summary>
            While Runners execute before app code is run, presenters are run after app code has been
            executed at the end of each frame. Presenters are quick and executed in the same thread.

        <member name="T:DeltaEngine.Core.Runner">
            <summary>
            Allows classes to automatically run before any app code each frame (clearing, actors, physics,
            etc.). Runners are executed in threads based on dependencies used in their constructors.
